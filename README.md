# Creating Summary Fit Tables for LCA and LTA Analyses Using

This syntax automates the process of generating a model fit summary table for comparing a series of LCA models generated during enumeration. The code produces a publication read table that approximately adheres to APA formatting guidelines. Included in the table is the exhaustive set of fit indices recommended as current best practice for making enumeration decisions based on simulations by Nylund et al., 2007. A separate example is provided below to demonstrate the procedure for an LTA analysis with two time points.
